                <p class="lead">For the last time, I don't like lilacs! Your 'first' wife was the one who liked lilacs! So, how 'bout them Knicks? There, now he's trapped in a book I wrote: a crummy world of plot holes and spelling errors!</p>
                <p>Fry! Stay back! He's too powerful! Do a flip! With gusto. Man, I'm sore all over. I feel like I just went ten rounds with mighty Thor. Oh, I don't have time for this. I have to go and buy a single piece of fruit with a coupon and then return it, making people wait behind me while I complain.</p>
                <p>Ven ve voke up, ve had zese wodies. And when we woke up, we had these bodies. Well I'da done better, but it's plum hard pleading a case while awaiting trial for that there incompetence. You won't have time for sleeping, soldier, not with all the bed making you'll be doing.</p>
